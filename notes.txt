For the exercises:

Thought I could conveniently leave out the Author -> User fact relation as User seemed to serve no purpose to the model, but found that without a distinct User relation, an Author is ambiguous on it's own.  Trying to declare multiple authors for the same blog without a user to distinguish them is impossible.  This was pointed out to me by the replicator write endpoint:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "ux_fact".  This was because an author fact does not include it's reference name - only it's attributes/predecessor references.  The model in the exercises does not declare a fact type for User, so I fabricated a single arbitrary property `relation` to give "uniqueness".
